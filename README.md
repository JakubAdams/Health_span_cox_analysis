With this code I aimed to calculate the effect sizes (if any) prescription drugs may have on healthspan.
To this end, Cox proportional hazards models were run between healthspan, defined as time from enrollment
to first diagnosis of an age-related disease, and prescription drugs, in individuals taking them long-term.
Electronic health record data linkage was used to ascertain prescriptions and diagnoses.

we were able to recover the protective effects of drugs like atorvastatin and vitamins,
as well as finding effects for various drugs with anti-inflammatory
properties like triamcinolone, diclofenac among others.
